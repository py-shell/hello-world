# hello-world
A place for Python and PowerShell programs and scripts.

I've been in IT for about 12 years and I've used PowerShell pretty regularly for about the last 6. I'm currently a SysAdmin and I've become proficient at writing scipts with powerShell and now have begun the process of learning Python.
